/**
 * A string S containing only the letters "A", "B" and "C" is given. The string can be transformed
 * by removing one occurrence of "AA", "BB" or "CC".
 * <p>
 * Transformation of the string is the process of removing letters from it, based on the rules
 * described above. As long as at least one rule can be applied, the process should be repeated. If
 * more than one rule can be used, any one of them could be chosen.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public String solution(String S); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns any string that can result from a
 * sequence of transformations as described above.
 * <p>
 * For example, given string S = "ACCAABBC" the function may return "AC", because one of the
 * possible sequences of transformations is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Also, given string S = "ABCBBCBA" the function may return "", because one possible sequence of
 * transformations is:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, for string S = "BABABA" the function must return "BABABA", because no rules can be
 * applied to string S.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * the length of string S is within the range [0..50,000]; string S consists only of the following
 * characters: "A", "B" and/or "C". Copyright 2009â€“2022 by Codility Limited. All Rights Reserved.
